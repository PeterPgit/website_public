<h4>Here are a list of house games!</h4>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://spyfall.tannerkrewson.com/">Spyfall</a></li>
    <dt>- "In short, when the game begins, one random player will become the spy,
        and all others will be given a location, and a role within the location. For example,
        if the location of a round was "restaurant," one player might be the chef, another the
        waiter, another the customer, etc. The players will not know who the spy is, and the spy
        will not know the location. Players take turns asking questions to each other, doing their
        best not to outright reveal the location in their questions and answers, but not being too
        vague as to raise suspicion." </dt>
    <li>Game 2</li>
    <dt>- This is the second game in the list!</dt>
