    <h2>about</h2>
    <div class="float container" style="margin: 25px">
      <p style="margin-left: 30px;">starting out as a quarantine project, this website is my very first attempt at some
        sort of coding, with everything you see on this page written by stratch. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 30px;"> initially written in pycharm, I
        transitioned to visual studio code which is what is used now to write/edit this website. everything is hosted
        through Github Pages, and all of the source code can be viewed by
        clicking the link at the bottom (looks like <a class="fas fa-file-code"></a>). there you'll
        find everything written with basic html, css, and js (with hints of jquery). you can also visit my Github
        repo to view all of the projects i've been working on. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 30px;">i'm looking to learn more about pgp encryption, so linked at the bottom of this
        page is my pgp public key. technology (digital privacy in particular) has been an interest of mine, and i'm
        always looking to learn more. (that's why this website exists!)</p>

    <h2>house games</h2>
    <div class="float container" id="main-container">
      <h4 style="margin-left: 10px;">Here are a list of house games!</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://spyfall.tannerkrewson.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spyfall</a>
          <p>- "In short, when the game begins, one random player will become the spy,
            and all others will be given a location, and a role within the location. For example,
            if the location of a round was "restaurant," one player might be the chef, another the
            waiter, another the customer, etc. The players will not know who the spy is, and the spy
            will not know the location. Players take turns asking questions to each other, doing their
            best not to outright reveal the location in their questions and answers, but not being too
            vague as to raise suspicion." </p>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://drawphone.tannerkrewson.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drawphone</a>
          <p>- "It works like the telephone game, in which "one person whispers a message
            to another, which is passed through a line of people until the last player
            announces the message to the entire group."
            <br>
            - Minimum of 4 players
