      <p>hello! if you're reading this, it means you've found my website one way or another. thanks for checking things
        out! to be honest, I don't quite have an exact reason for making this website in the first place; it just seemed
        like it would be fun and gets me to learn something new. as noted in the home page, this all started out as a
        quarantine project. it all started from a blank page and slowly but surely, with many, many tutorials + youtube
        videos later, developed into what you're seeing today. </p>

      <p>I'll sporadically update this from time to time with whatever pops into my head. this'll act as a page for me
        to express all of my ideas and stuff that I constantly think about.</p>

      <p>as for starters, you've probably noticed the grammar in which I type everything out. that's not because I'm
        lazy or anything, but instead because I feel like it adds voice to my writing. because of the nature of
        communicating online, it can be hard to communicate and interpret emotion within a piece of text. the lack of
        capitalization serves to both denote informal writing and sets the tone of the words. </p>
      <br>
      <p>for example, a sentence like:</p>
      <blockquote>Hello, how are you doing today?</blockquote>
      <p>feels formal, less unique, and is the standard writing.</p>
      <p>however,</p>
      <blockquote>hello, how are you doing today?</blockquote>
      <p>provokes a different emotion. the lack of fomality instead feels like a friend talking to a friend. it's more
        soft spoken and feels more genuine.</p>
      <br>
      <p>some other examples include:</p>
      <blockquote>HELLO, HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY?</blockquote>
      <p>to denote anger, or its real life equivalent of screaming</p>
      <p>and</p>
      <blockquote>hElLo, HoW aRe YoU dOiNg ToDaY?</blockquote>
      <p>to denote sarcasm.</p>
      <br>
      <p>the goal of this website is to act as a place for me to talk about different projects, goals, and interests. I
        want it to lack formality and to instead act as a way for people to see some insight on my life. it's a place
        for me to express different feelings and explain my thoughts on different topics. it's as if I'm talking to a friend, yet
        that friend is a random person behind a screen. </p>
